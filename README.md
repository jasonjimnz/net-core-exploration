# .Net Core Exploration
 I don't know .NET Core so, it will be funny

## Version 0.0.1

- Initial state of the API, first GET request
- I'm following [this tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/es-es/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-3.1&tabs=visual-studio-code#overview)
- First time with .NET Core, HELP!

### Issues
- 0.0.1
    - It supposed to launch in the url declared in launchSettings.json file but
    it ignores me, maybe a missconfiguration of Visual Studio Code or something
    else
